`My Shiny Metal Tooth` is an **illuminated sign** I built for my fatherâ€™s dental clinic. The project is in progress.

A **5 mm** thick **anodized wire** is used to build a **frame**. The **lighting** is realized with **EL Wire**. The whole sign operates autonomously. A **DS1307 RTC** module is used for timekeeping. The **sunset time** is calculated for each day, so the system knows when to turn on. An ATTiny85 will probably control the sign.

For more details on the design and construction, take a look at the tutorial on the [wiki](https://github.com/pAIgn10/My-Shiny-Metal-Tooth/wiki/Tutorial).
